To decide what conservation actions to do where - we need to know what the greatest threats to habitats and species are and where they occur. Our research synthesizes new and existing data to quantify the *what* and *where* of human impacts on biodiversity from local to global scales, with a particular emphasis on 1) the impacts of food production, 2) spatial conservation planning, 3) land-sea interactions and 4) achieving conservation targets. This work can then be used to quantify patterns between different locations, assess trade-offs between management actions, and inform conservation decisions.
