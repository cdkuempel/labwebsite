#### The published [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534722002221) is available on-line.

There is a disconnect between global high-level conservation goals and onthe-ground actions such as maintaining ecosystem services or planning for protected areas, particularly for connectivity goals. We show how connectivity can be included in conservation planning objectives and connected to high-level goals.
