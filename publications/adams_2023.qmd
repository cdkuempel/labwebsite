Given their substantial contributions to meeting area-based targets, we review evidence of multiple-use protected areas in meeting global policy goals. We found that multiple-use protected areas can be effective in conserving biodiversity and are more likely to be under equitable governance arrangements than their strict counterparts. Our results show that multiple-use and other protected areas provide important environmental and socio-economic benefits that are needed to achieve the 2030 target.
