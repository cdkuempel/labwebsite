#### The published [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-00965-x) and [code](https://github.com/OHI-Science/global_food_pressures) are available on-line.

We quantified pressures resulting from food production (cover 99% of food produced) including greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater use, nutrient pollution, and spatial disturbance. We then created a cumulative index to identify hotspots and relative efficiencies in production between sectors and locations.
