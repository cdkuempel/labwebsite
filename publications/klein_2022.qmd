Fisheries can cause environmental degradation. These impacts can be displaced when one country fishes in another country's waters. This may be particularly problematic when the fished country has less ability to manage it's fisheries or marine resources than the fishiing country. We quantified the extent of "unequal" fishing displacement between countries to assess the countries who participate the most in this practice and the countries that potential are the most impacted.
