#### The published [paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-coastal-futures/article/integrated-watershed-management-solutions-for-healthy-coastal-ecosystems-and-people/F0CB95FB6FC43C6BA9805D3409888CBB) is available on-line.

This review summarises the evidence of impacts to coastal ecosystems, particularly coral reefs, from sediments, nutrients, chemicals and pathogens entering coastal zones through surface and groundwater. We also assess how these pollutants affect the health of coastal human populations through: (1) enhanced transmission of infectious diseases; (2) reduced food availability and nutritional deficit from decline of fisheries associated with degraded habitat; and (3) food poisoning from consumption of contaminated seafood.
