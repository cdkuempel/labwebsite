The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) includes four goals and 23 targets to halt biodiversity loss and restore natural ecosystems by 2030 (1). The list includes goals to reduce pollution from sources such as plastics and nutrients (Target 7) but overlooks sediment---a key driver of poor water quality that threatens freshwater and marine ecosystems. To conserve aquatic environments, the global community must prioritize explicit indicators and commitments to reduce excess sediment.
