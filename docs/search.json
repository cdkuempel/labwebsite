Students will learn about the modelling methods that inform ecosystem management. Students will utilise the R programming environment to simulate the processes that determine marine ecosystem population dynamics. Prerequisite: Student must have completed 160CP."

In the Conservation Action Team, our research synthesizes new and existing data to quantify the what and where of human impacts on biodiversity from local to global scales and the actions that can be taken to reduce these threats. Our work largely falls within four main themes: 1) impacts of food production, 2) spatial conservation planning, 3) land-sea interactions and 4) achieving conservation targets. This work can be used to quantify patterns between different locations, assess trade-offs between management actions, and inform conservation and sustainable development decisions."
