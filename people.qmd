## **Dr Caitie Kuempel**

I am currently a Lecturer in Ecological Modelling at Griffith Univeristy (Brisbane, Australia).

## Education

**PhD in Conservation Science** \| Nov. 2014-Aug. 2018 University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia

**MSc Marine Biology** \| Aug. 2011 - Dec. 2012 Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA

**BSc Environmental Science** \| Aug. 2007-May 2011 **BA French** \| Aug. 2007-May 2012

University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA

## Experience

I am an experienced spatial modeler of environmental impact across a range of human activities and scales. These models can be used to quantify patterns and potential impacts on humans and nature, assess trade-offs between management actions, and develop systematic conservation plans.

Please see my [CV](https://github.com/cdkuempel/CV/blob/master/CV.pdf) and [Griffith Expert](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/37253-caitie-kuempel) page for more information.

## **Dr Jackson Stockbridge**

Jackson is a post-doctoral researcher with the [Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre](https://blueeconomycrc.com.au/).

## Education

**PhD in Environmental Sciences** \| 2018-2022 University of Adelaide

**BSc Science (Hons)** \| 2014-2017 Marine Biology and Evolutionary Biology

## Experience

Having grown up in the UK, Jackson moved to Adelaide South Australia to undertake a bachelor's degree in marine biology. He then went on to complete his PhD, where he evaluated common assumptions of methods to calculate the impact of multiple stressors on marine environments. He is now working with the Australian Rivers Institute at Griffith University, using spatial data to map how the cumulative effects of multiple stressors impact different industries, and how this information can be used to understand risk in marine spatial planning.
