## **Dr Caitie Kuempel**

I am currently a Lecturer in Ecological Modelling at Griffith Univeristy (Brisbane, Australia).

## Education

**PhD in Conservation Science** \| Nov. 2014-Aug. 2018 University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia

**MSc Marine Biology** \| Aug. 2011 - Dec. 2012 Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA

**BSc Environmental Science** \| Aug. 2007-May 2011 **BA French** \| Aug. 2007-May 2012

University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA

## Experience

I am an experienced spatial modeler of environmental impact across a range of human activities and scales. These models can be used to quantify patterns and potential impacts on humans and nature, assess trade-offs between management actions, and develop systematic conservation plans.

Please see my [CV](https://github.com/cdkuempel/CV/blob/master/CV.pdf) and [Griffith Expert](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/37253-caitie-kuempel) page for more information.

## **Dr Jackson Stockbridge**

Jackson is a post-doctoral researcher with the [Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre](https://blueeconomycrc.com.au/).

## Education

**PhD in Environmental Sciences** \| 2018-2022 University of Adelaide

**BSc Science (Hons)** \| 2014-2017 Marine Biology and Evolutionary Biology

## Experience

Having grown up in the UK, Jackson moved to Adelaide South Australia to undertake a bachelor's degree in marine biology. He then went on to complete his PhD, where he evaluated common assumptions of methods to calculate the impact of multiple stressors on marine environments. He is now working with the Australian Rivers Institute at Griffith University, using spatial data to map how the cumulative effects of multiple stressors impact different industries, and how this information can be used to understand risk in marine spatial planning.

## **Marina Christofidis**

Marina is a PhD student in the School of Environment and Science at Griffith University since April 2023.

## Education

**MSc Environmental Engineering** \| 2004-2006 Federal University of Santa Catarina, FLorianopolis, Brazil

**BSc Biological Sciences** \| 1996-2001 University of Brasilia, Brazil

## Experience

In her master's degree in Florianopolis Marina researched participatory approaches for Water Quality Framework establishment. After that she spent time working as a consultant in environmental impact assessment. She has been a Federal Employee in Brazil since 2008 as a Water Infrastructure Analyst where she focused on managing the many uses of Coastal Common areas both in land and water by multiple stakeholders. For her PhD thesis, she will explore climate change impacts on aquaculture. She is also enthusiastic about Marine Spatial Planning and environmental restoration.
