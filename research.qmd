Our research increases understanding of human impacts and informs conservation decisions under four main themes: sustainable food production (particularly seafood), conservation planning, land-sea interactions, and achieving conservation targets. Our work is largely centered on how we can best conserve the world's oceans while considering the needs of the growing human population.
